1) What is the major difference between the http and https protocol?


=>
Feature
	HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
	HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
	Security
	Data is sent in "Plain Text."
	Data is encrypted (scrambled).
	Port
	Uses Port 80.
	Uses Port 443.
	Privacy
	Vulnerable to "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks.
	Protects against eavesdropping.
	Trust
	No identity verification.
	Requires an SSL/TLS Certificate.
	SEO
	No benefit.
	Google gives higher rankings to HTTPS sites.
	







2) What are the layers where this http and https protocols work?


=> they work at layer 7 in the osi model that is the application layer


3) Describe the osi model of data flow?
1. Layer 7: Application (The Interface)
* What happens: This is where you interact with the computer. You type a message in a browser (HTTPS) or an email client.
* Data form: Data.
2. Layer 6: Presentation (The Translator)
* What happens: The computer translates the data into a format the network understands. It handles encryption (like the "S" in HTTPS) and compression.
* Data form: Data.
3. Layer 5: Session (The Manager)
* What happens: It opens a "session" or a conversation between your device and the server. It’s like a phone call—it makes sure the connection stays open while you talk.
* Data form: Data.
4. Layer 4: Transport (The Logistics)
* What happens: This layer decides how to send the data (TCP for reliability or UDP for speed). It breaks the big data into smaller pieces.
* Data form: Segments.
5. Layer 3: Network (The Post Office)
* What happens: It looks at the destination IP Address and decides the best path across the internet to get there (Routing).
* Data form: Packets.
6. Layer 2: Data Link (The Delivery Truck)
* What happens: It prepares the packet for the physical wire/Wi-Fi. It adds the hardware address (MAC Address) of the next "hop" (like your router).
* Data form: Frames.
7. Layer 1: Physical (The Wire)
* What happens: The frames are converted into electrical pulses, light flashes, or radio waves and sent across the cable or through the air.
* Data form: Bits (1s and 0s).
4) What is the difference between the TCP and UDP protocol?


Feature
	TCP
	UDP
	Reliability
	Guaranteed. Data arrives intact.
	Unreliable. Data might be lost.
	Speed
	Slower (due to checking).
	Much Faster (no checking).
	Order
	Arrives in the exact order sent.
	Can arrive in any order.
	Connection
	Connection-oriented (Handshake).
	Connectionless (No Handshake).
	Common Use
	Web Browsing (HTTPS), Email, Files.
	Gaming, Video Calls, Streaming.
	

5) how can one decide which protocol to use ?
* Use TCP when you need 100% accuracy. If you are downloading a program or a bank statement, even one missing bit could corrupt the entire file or change your bank balance. You don't mind waiting an extra second for the "check-up."
* Use UDP when you need real-time speed. If you are on a Zoom call or playing Call of Duty, and one packet is lost, you get a tiny "glitch" or a pixelated face for a split second. That is much better than the whole call pausing for 5 seconds while the computer tries to re-download a single missing frame. In live situations, old data is useless data.
 6) write the basic connecting networking commands operate at      
     layer-3?
ping: The most basic test. It sends a tiny packet to an IP address to see if it’s alive and   how long the "round trip" takes.
Example: ping google.com
traceroute(Linux) / tracert (Windows): Shows you every router (hop) your data passes through to reach a destination. Great for seeing exactly where a connection is failing.
Example: traceroute google.com










7) What are the commands which give the info about the ports and connection?


  => netstat -tunlp: A classic command to see every active connection.
* -t: TCP connections
* -u: UDP connections
* -n: Show numbers (IPs) instead of names
* -l: Show "listening" ports (apps waiting for data)
* -p: Show which program is using the port


8) What are the dns troubleshooting commands in linux ?


* dig: The professional way to look up DNS records. It tells you exactly what the "Address Book" of the internet says about a domain.
   * Example: dig google.com


* nslookup: A simpler, older tool to find the IP address of a domain name.


 9) what are the commands used for getting all the network  
    Interfaces?


* ip addr (Modern Linux) / ifconfig (Old Linux): Shows your IP address, MAC address, and whether your network card is actually "Up."
* ip link: Focuses specifically on the physical/hardware status of your network cards.
* ip neigh / arp -a: Shows the ARP Table  (the list of local neighbors and their MAC addresses).
