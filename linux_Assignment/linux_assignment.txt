1) storage related commands like how much the system is consuming, how much space is free and what are the processes that have taken the most space?
=> df -h
          Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
          /dev/sda1        50G   20G   28G  42% /
          tmpf          3.8G     0  3.8G   0% /dev/shm
 => top
      -it will display all the processes running currently along with the memory      
         and cpu consumption


2) fetch out the directories which is having only the read and execute permissions ?


=> find  /home/diwas   -type d  -perm  /u+rx,g+rx,o+rx  
     find   /home/diwas  -type d  -perm   555


3)how to list down all processes ?how to kill the force normally as well as forcefully?
=>ps aux 
   -to list down all the processes of all the users running including  the one 
    running without terminal
=> kill pid
               -to kill the process gracefully 
=> kill -9 pid
                -to forcefully kill the processes




4)how to run the process in background?
=> python scripy.py &
                               - using & sign at the last of the command we can run processes in the         
                                 the background here also this python script will run in the background 


5)how to bring back a process from background to foreground?
    => bg %jobnumber


6)how to search for the error files among all the log files ?


   =>grep -r “error” /var/log 
           -it will search recursively inside the log directory for all the error files




7) how to search for  some pattern in a file  and replace it with some other pattern?
=> sed -i 's/error/warning/gi' app.log
 -it will edit the file in place and basically substitute error with warning      wherever it appears in the file 




8)how to create  logical volume out of some physical volume and create some filesystem out of that and mount it somewhere in the virtual directory?
     


=> Disk → Physical Volume → Volume Group → Logical Volume → Filesystem → Directory


      Step 1: Identify available disks
       Command - lsblk
     
     
     Step 2: Create Physical Volume (PV)
      Command -pvcreate /dev/sdb
   
     Step 3: Create Volume Group (VG)
      command-vgcreate my_vg /dev/sdb


     Step 4: Create Logical Volume (LV)
       command-lvcreate -L 5G -n my_lv my_vg


     Step 5: Create filesystem on the Logical Volume
       command-mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/my_lv


    Step 6: Create a directory (mount point)
       command-mkdir /mnt/mydata


    Step 7: Mount the filesystem
       command-mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt/mydata




9)how to unmount the filesystem ??


=> command - umount   /dev/my_vg/my_lv
